# Tips for leading a session

There are several points for running sessions at an unconference.

You do not need to prepare for leading a session. If you get an idea
while at the event, find a free timeslot and add a session. If you
have a short pitch prepared, that also is awesome!

There is one "right way"&tm; to lead a session, but a rule of thumb
is the more interactive the better.

Chose a format that will help you achieve your vision for the session

## Session formats

Below is a list of session formats that work well in our experience.

### [Birds of a Feather](https://github.com/nnf-cbn/2019-unconference/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bof.md&title=)

In a [Birds of a Feather](https://github.com/nnf-cbn/2019-unconference/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bof.md&title=)
session, someone identifies a topic they are interested in, and others
join for an interesting group discussion.


### [My big (or little) question](https://github.com/nnf-cbn/2019-unconference/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=my_question.md&title=)

If you have a question you want answered, and you think some of the
other attendees can help you find an answer, suggest a
[my big (or little) question](https://github.com/nnf-cbn/2019-unconference/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=my_question.md&title=)
session. As the name implies, the scope of the question doesn't
really matter, as long as you and hopefully others can learn something
from the session.


### [Show and tell](https://github.com/nnf-cbn/2019-unconference/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=show_and_tell.md&title=)

If you have a cool project or technology around software sustainability
that you want to show to people, a [show and tell](https://github.com/nnf-cbn/2019-unconference/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=show_and_tell.md&title=)
session is the way to go.


### [Lightning talk](https://github.com/nnf-cbn/2019-unconference/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=lightning_talk.md&title=)

Ideal as a wrap-up session for one or more of the other session types,
a [lightning talk](https://github.com/nnf-cbn/2019-unconference/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=lightning_talk.md&title=)
session has one or more short (3-5 minutes) presentations, presenting the
results of the discussions in one of the other sessions in a more concise form.


## Further advice

### Hold the space

When you lead a session, it is your responsibility to "hold the space" for your
session. You can do this by leading a discussion, posing a first question, or
by sharing information on your project or tool, depending on the session type.
Stay visible, be involved, help to guide the group.

### Ask for help if needed

If you feel like you need help in leading your session, mention this in your
session proposal. Someone else might be willing to step up and help out.

### Don't assume people in the room know less or more than you do

The idea is to have people at the session who are interested in the session
topic, regardless of their prior experience with it.

### Don't be upset if only two people show up for your session

The two people who do show up shre your passion for the topic,
what more could you ask for?

### Don't feel like you have to "fill" your time slot

As mentioned in the [README](README.md), if what you wanted to say only
takes 15 minutes and the group has finished interacting, feel free to
end the session at that point.

### Don't feel presured if you "only" have this time slot

If a session runs past the allotted time slot, propose a follow-up session.

### Be brave!

Others are intersted in making your session work. Just go for it.

### Think about what you want to cover in your session, but don't overthink

It's good if you have a bit of a plan on how to cover the ideas you
want to talk about in your session. But don't overprepare, that tends
to lose the energy of the interaction between the participants.

### Experiment with the different session types

Don't feel restricted in only leading sessions of one type.
